  ## Delete Saved Query

  Deletes a saved query by its ID (path parameter).

  **Prerequisites:** Run "Save Query (Create)" first to create a query.
  Adjust the ID in the URL if it differs from 1.

  **Expected Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "success": true
  }
  ```

  **Verification:**
  After running, call `GET /saved_queries` to confirm the query was removed.

  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - ✅ Deletes the saved query
  - ✅ Returns success status
  - ✅ Query no longer appears in GET /saved_queries
  - ✅ Requires admin authentication
}
